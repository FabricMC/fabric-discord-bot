# The below regular expressions are inspired by or taken from the excellent filter system maintained by
# the folks at Python Discord. You can find their bot code here: https://github.com/python-discord/bot.
# Of course, we've made some changes to the list as well. Please note that each non-empty line that
# doesn't start with a # is a separate regex, aside from the first one - which exists to aid with IDE support.
# Comments at the end of a line are not supported.
